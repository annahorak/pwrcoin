# Wallet

Cryptocurrency wallet is a software or device that allows user to store, receive and send digital currency. Money itself is not stored in wallet, instead it stores both private and public key of currency client, allowing to exchange currency and acts as a personal ledger.

Typically, for given currency there is one official wallet, that is most widely used. For example, there is Bitcoin Core Wallet, Litecoin Core or Etherum Wallet.There are also universal wallets, that can be used for many \(but not all\) cryptocurrencies. The examples of them are Coinomi or Holytransaction. This is also called multicurrency. After all, there are hardware wallets, that are especially reliable and secure physical devices, that are used for storing coins. They offer a lot, but require extra money spend on device. Some software advertised as wallets can be mallware trying to take advantage of people willing to download and use unoficiall wallets, so users must be aware and careful when choosing one.  
Software wallets can exist in form of application that is installed locally on computer, or web wallet that is menaged by a third party.There is distinction of "hot" and "cold" wallets. A hot one is connected to Internet, so can be used at any time, but is constantly vulnerable to attacks. On the other hand, a cold wallet is for example hardware wallet, which cannot be accessed without pluging it into computer.

A reasonable choice for a newly created cryptocurrency would be to opt for one of universal wallets that are already available.It might be somehow limited in configuration but doesn't require developing solution from ground up and offers reliable and much more tested functionality.
