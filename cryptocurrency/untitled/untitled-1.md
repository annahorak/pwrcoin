_Full Node Wallet Clients_ - you have to download the entire blockchain onto your computer. As a result, you become a validator and you support the blockchain network. Unfortunately, the data will take up a large part of your disk and synchronization will take a long time.

Light Wallet Clients - you have not to download blockchain, so synchronization is faster. The cons is that light wallets don't isolate your private keys when you're online.
