# Proof of Stake

In proof of stake miners have no reason to exist. Their place replaces validates, but their task is the same â€“ they must confirm the transactions and place them on the chain.  
For a private network may be better than proof of work, but still does not provide us with a level of control and security, because anyone in the chain can become a validator, if it links enough ether to the validator contract.

  
Unlike PoW, proof of stake does not generate new coins.

  
**DISADVANTAGES:**

* concentration of power in the hands of the largest holders, which is in contradiction with the concept of decentralization of cryptocurrencies
* be a validator and have the ability to influence the future of a given coin

The most famous Cryptocurrency that uses Proof of Stake is Ethereum.
