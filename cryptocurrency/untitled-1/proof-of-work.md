# Proof of Work

Proof of work is nothing else than searching for the appropriate function of a shortcut that meets specific criteria. The operation of searching for the appropriate hash is digging BTC \(mining\).  
Solving the problem is difficult to find, but itâ€™s easy to verify by the rest of the network.  
When one miner gets a solution, he provides the solution to others. The next step is to verify this solution and reach the consensus. Mines must iterate through many numbers to find a solution.

  
PoW encourages you to centralize your strength instead of focusing on a distributed network.The most famous Cryptocurrency that uses Proof of Work is Bitcoin.

**DISADVANTAGES:**

* time-consuming
* energy consumption \(large computing power\) 
* 51% risk
* every attacker with 51% or more of mining resources \(mining mine\) will control the network.
* more and more efficient digging equipment is needed
