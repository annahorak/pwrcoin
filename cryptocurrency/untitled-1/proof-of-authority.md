# Proof of Authority

Proof of authority delivers fast and immediate transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake.

  
PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is minimized.Almost perfect solution for private networks, but is not suitable for public networks, where trust should be as scattered as possible.

  
**ADVANTAGES for private networks:**

* safer due to the way of adding authorization nodes
* provides more configurability in terms of blocking times and delays
* it is not costly in terms of calculation

  
New concept in the blockchain where you have a number of pre-approved authority nodes \(sealers\). When you want to add new node, it has to be voted by the currently approved set of authority nodes. This gives you full control over nodes which can seal blocks.

In proof of authority the identity must be true, so we need to verify the validators and check if they are who they claim they are. Eligibility for staking identity should be difficult to obtain. The procedure of establishing the authority needs to be the same for all validators.

  
The Proof of authority consensus need to ensure independency of validators and the necessity of giving them the means to protect their nodes.
