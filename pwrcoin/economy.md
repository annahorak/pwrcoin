## Value of coins

Initial value of PWrCoin would be set by Authorities during configuration of cryptocurrency. Because PWrCoin will be exchangable with different cryptocurrencies its real value will be determined by people trading this crypto.  


## Amount of coins

As value - maximum amount of coins would be set by Authorities during configuration.  


## PWrCoin Acceptance

For a while any official institution don't accept PWrCoin, but we hope that we will find providers who will put their interest in our project.  


## PWrCoin Editions

Configuration script should give possiblity to add year postfix to crypto name.  


## Exchange

Exchange for real currencies is in discussion. Although we would like to create whole system of University cryptocurrencies with coins of equal value, so there would be no problem with exchanging coins between different universities.
