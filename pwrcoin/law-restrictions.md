# Law restrictions

As the cryptocurrencies gained more interest and hype recently, the government response was to prepare and regulate laws related to them. The situation is still under development, because there are projects and legal acts being currently discused and processed.

Creating cyrptocurrencies per se is not forbidden by polish law. Although there are specified policies regulating digital cash and its transactions.When the cryptocurrency is designed so that for creation of it user must first pay an equivalent of traditional money - then the chance of interpreting it as digital money is extremely high.In such situation, creators can be accused of issuing money without required legitimation, and consequences might be serious.

As long as the cryptocurrency serves as an alternative to medium of exchange and is not exchanged for regular money there are little to no laws considered in it and it should be safe to create and exchange it.
